		This map and associated layers of data are provided for the purpose of illustrating the challenges
		and complexity of work required to correct fish passage barriers under Washington State highways.
		The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) makes no guarantee concerning the data's
		content, accuracy, completeness, or the results obtained from queries or use of the data,
		including the underlying base maps. The fish and wildlife data do not represent exhaustive
		inventories, but are compilations of knowledge from field biologists that are updated periodically
		as knowledge improves. It is important to note that habitats or species may occur on the ground in
		areas not currently known to those who prepared the data, or in areas for which comprehensive surveys
		have not been conducted. Site specific surveys are frequently necessary to rule out the presence of
		priority habitats or species. When planning or designing projects that may affect these sites,
		please consider using additional information gathered from field investigations and consultations
		with WSDOT, WDFW or other professional biologists. For WSDOT assistance on a specific project, or
		for more information, please contact:
