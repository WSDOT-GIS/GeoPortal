    <p>This map and associated layers of data are provided for the purpose of illustrating the challenges and complexity of work required to correct fish passage barriers under Washington State highways. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) makes no guarantee concerning the data's content, accuracy, completeness, or the results obtained from queries or use of the data, including the underlying base maps. The data supporting this map are from the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). The data do not represent exhaustive inventories, but are compilations of knowledge from field biologists that are updated periodically as knowledge improves. It is important to note that habitats or species may occur on the ground in areas not currently known to those who prepared the data, or in areas for which comprehensive surveys have not been conducted. Site specific surveys are frequently necessary to rule out the presence of priority habitats or species. When planning or designing projects that may affect these sites, please consider using additional information gathered from field investigations and consultations with WSDOT, WDFW or other professional biologists. For WSDOT assistance on a specific project, or for more information, please contact:</p>

    <p>Please note that the term “Potential Habitat Gain” on the pop-up tab for each site refers to the entire distance between the site and the natural end of fish habitat, excluding other human-caused barriers. This is the amount of upstream habitat that could potentially be accessed by fish if this and all other upstream barriers were removed, This map shows only barriers owned by WSDOT. There are many fish barriers in these streams that are not owned by WSDOT. WSDOT normally first corrects the highway barrier furthest downstream, providing incremental habitat gain up to the next barrier. The full Potential Habitat Gain is only achieved when all barriers on the stream are corrected.</p>
    <p><em>Caveat: This map is updated on a weekly cycle and may result in a fluctuation of barrier numbers when barriers are added, removed or reclassified.</em></p>
