<p>The Freight Map Application is intended to provide easy and free access to the Truck Performance Measure (TPM) data and truck freight information for public use. TPM Data is managed and maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation Freight Systems Division, and the rest of the data layers come from different sources. The layers have different degrees of accuracy, and some are more up to date than others. In order to keep up with what is happening in the real world, correct data entry errors, and incorporate newer and more accurate information, the data is regularly being updated and improved.</p>

<p>Please note that locations shown with slow truck speeds in the TPM layers may be caused by various factors such as geometric characteristics and may not be improved through infrastructure investment. </p>

<p>Metadata for the layers are provided as a resource to the user to understand the source, accuracy, date and purpose of each layer. WSDOT Freight Systems Division shall assume no liability for any decision made or action taken or not taken by users in reliance upon any information contained in this map.</p>
