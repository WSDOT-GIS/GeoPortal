        Habitat Connectivity Support Structures provides spatial information on
        structures built on or along the state highway system to benefit wildlife,
        usually by providing safe opportunities for wildlife to move past a
        highway or to reduce collisions.
        These include bridges, culverts, wildlife barrier fencing, jumpout
        ramps, and wildlife guards. It also includes structures that were never
        intended to benefit wildlife but, as a result of monitoring with
        motion-triggered cameras, have been shown to be providing significant
        safe wildlife passage.
