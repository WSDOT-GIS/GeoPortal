    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Habitat Connectivity Support Structures provides spatial information on
        1) existing structures on or along state highways that benefit wildlife passage across state highways (whether or not that use was intentional) and
        2) guidance to internal WSDOT project planners regarding opportunities to improve safety by considering connectivity needs in the design of future projects.
