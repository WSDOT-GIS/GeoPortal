### How to Display Data ###

1. Click on the Layers tab.
2. Check the box to make a map layer visible.
3. Once you have the box checked, you can hover over the checkbox to enable the layer options arrow. Layer options will allow you to adjust the layer transparency or read the layer metadata (information about how the dataset was developed).
4. Click on the Legend tab to see the map legend. The legend will update based on which map layers you have visible.

## Layer Specific Information ##

### WSDOT [Fish Passage Barriers](http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/habitat/fish_passage/) ###

WSDOT Fish Passage Barriers comes from the WDFW Fish Passage Barrier and Diversion Screening geodatabase. This layer does not include barriers assessed to be on non-fish bearing streams, or barriers that have been assessed to not have any fish blockage. They include culverts (road crossings or bridges over streams), miscellaneous barriers (fords, flumes, streambed  controls, …), and small diversion dams.

Barrier ID labels will appear when the scalebar reads 1 mile.

WSDOT Fish Passage Barriers are represented in several different ways.

1. Corrected Barriers Statewide
2. Uncorrected Barriers Statewide
3. Corrected Barriers Case Area
4. In-Design Barriers Case Area
5. Uncorrected Barriers Case Area

### [Case](http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/trt/index.cfm) Area Boundary ###

This is the Case Area Boundary for U. S. District Court Injunction No. C70-9213, Subproceeding No. 01-1, the U.S. versus Washington State.  The case area is comprised of Water Resource Inventory Areas 1 to 23.

### [Rivers](http://nhd.usgs.gov/) and Lakes ###

The Rivers and Lakes Layer uses the hi-resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD), a USGS product that is the Federal and State hydrographic data standard, and now forms the basis for ‘the blue lines’ on all USGS topographic maps. It depicts rivers and streams as lines, and also as polygons for larger rivers (NHD Area), along with lakes, ponds, and reservoirs (NHD Waterbodies).

Rivers and Lakes is a multi-scaled layer, meaning that as you zoom in you will see additional streams, waterbodies, and streams names. The maximum detail is seen when the scalebar reads 1mi.

## Zoom Controls ##

Pan by clicking and dragging anywhere on the main map

### Zoom In and Out ###

Adjust the map zoom by clicking the + and - buttons near the top left of the map. Alternatively, you can also use your mouse scroll wheel to zoom, or double click to zoom in one level.

You can go back and forth to your previous extents and zooms by clicking on the next / previous extent buttons (magnifying glass icons in the ToolBar in the upper right of the map), like the back and forward buttons on a browser.

Return to full extent by clicking the home icon in the upper left of the map.

### Zoom to Tools ###

In the Tools tab, users can find tools to zoom to a specific fish passage barrier, state route milepost, longitude/latitude location, county, city, urban area, and address.

Zoom to a Fish Passage Barrier, County, City, or Urban Area

1. Begin typing into the appropriate text box.
2. A list of items will appear in the box. You can keep typing to further narrow down the results.
3. Select your choice by clicking on it.

### Zoom to Long./Lat. ###

1. Type in the Longitude coordinate (X), and the Latitude coordinate (Y).
2. Click on the Zoom to XY button (the magnifying glass) to zoom to that location.
3. The tool will accept coordinates in decimal degrees (e.g. -122.089441, 46.596825). If you want the coordinate to be in the western hemisphere, be sure to make your longitude value negative.

### Zoom to State Route Milepost ###

1. Find Milepost - Type in a route number, an ARM or SRMP, and a reference date, and then click on the Find Milepost button. A graphic dot and a callout text box will be placed at the location that you specify. If the tool is unable to find your location, it will return an error message.
2. Find Nearest Milepost - Specify a search radius, and click on the Find button. Then click on the map to see the nearest State Route and Mile Post.
3. Click on the clear results button to clear the graphics off of your map.

### Zoom to a specific address ###

1. At the bottom of the Tools tab you’ll see Find an Address bar. Click on that and enter an address into the text box and press search (magnifier) button
2. Click the Zoom To bar to go back to the other locators

## Interrogate Active Layers ##

### Retrieve information ###

Click on any feature on the map, except Rivers and Lakes, and a popup window will appear that contains additional information about what you clicked on. If there are multiple active layers where you click, you can cycle through them using the arrow buttons at the top of the window.

If you get too many features in the popup window try zooming in closer and/or turning off layers.

## Change How You See the Map ##

### Changing the Map Layers ###

Select the map layers you wish to view under the Layers tab. Click to check the box and turn the layer on. The Layer list is collapsible by clicking on the blue layer header.

### Changing the Drawing Order of Layers ###

Double-click the Arrange Layers button in the Toolbar.  This shows all the visible layers. Drag and drop the layer names in the order that you want them to draw on the map (top layer draws last, i.e., on top of the other layers). You usually want the Basemap layers at the bottom. The basemap is only called “layer”.  The default drawing order of layers is the first layers you turn on draw first and the last layers you turned on draw last. For instance, if you turn on a fish barrier layer, then turn on the City Limits layer, the City Limits layer will draw over the fish barriers. Use the Arrange Layers tool to drag the city layer down in the list.  The change to the map occurs as soon as you drag a layer.

### Legend ###

Layer legends can be found under the legends tab. Only active and visible layers are shown in the legend.

A PDF showing all the symbols for all layers can be found here.

### Change the Background Map ###

Clicking the 'Basemap' tab allows you to select a different background map.

### Share ###

Share current map extent URL using the star button in the ToolBar. Pasting this into another browser window will re-establish the map with the current layers visibility, extent and zoom. You can save this link in a document, or email it to a colleague so they can see the same map you are seeing.
